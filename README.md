# Connect Four Project

## CPSC 210 2020 WT1

I plan to create an application that will allow the user
to play connect four, a common strategy game. While easy
to play and learn basic strategy, it doesn't have an obvious way to win
(like tic-tac-toe). It will have:
- single-player mode (playing 
against the computer) 
- two-player mode (two users playing
against each other) 

Anyone can use this application. It isn't something that
will have much impact of the user's life but rather would be used
 entertainment, friendly competition between
friends, or as a way to sharpen one's brain. 

As a kid, I had a handheld connect four game that I
spent a lot of time playing and that taught me the 
strategy of the game. I am interested in this
project both because it is something I personally enjoy and
because I already have some idea of the complex logic
of being good at the game but I still have more to learn. 
In particular, I would explore this logic by creating
the best possible automated oppenent for single player mode.
In addition, although this application doesn't have a direct
application to my field of study, the simple artificial
intelligence of the automated oppenent is certainly a step
toward work that I hope to do in the future.

#User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to select a one or two player game before each game
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle between CPU difficulty (may add later)
- As a user, I want to be able to add a game piece of my own color to any of the allowed spots on the board
- As a user, I want to be able to see when the game is over and be told who won
- As a user, I want to be able to end the program or restart with the same options when a game is over
